# Introduction

The University of Colorado Boulder is defined by a majestic setting where the Great Plains meet the Rocky Mountain foothills, providing a natural backdrop that contributes to a profound sense of place. As we continue to evolve as a leading public research university, our campus must physically manifest our commitment to innovation, diversity, and excellence. However, we recognize that for the first-time visitor, the student navigating their first week, or the guest faculty member seeking a specific laboratory, this landscape can be a source of significant environmental anxiety. For this reason, we are proud to introduce these new Wayfinding and Signage Standards, a cornerstone of our "Calm Campus" initiative.

Navigation is the first act of university hospitality. By designing our environment to serve the most vulnerable user—the guest who has never stepped foot on our grounds—we create a system that works more effectively for every member of our community. We are moving definitively away from a history of ad-hoc, reactionary signage that has accumulated over decades, often resulting in visual noise and "information creep" that obscures our architectural legacy. In its place, we are establishing a coordinated layer of the built environment that speaks with the authority of an expert navigator and the warmth of a welcoming host.

These standards are not merely a manual for fabrication; they are a long-term investment in the dignity of the human experience at CU Boulder. We view our signage as the structural bones of our campus communication, designed with a philosophy of mechanical permanence to protect our hundred-year investment in our buff sandstone masonry. Whether through the high-contrast "ADA Blue" that signals our commitment to universal equity or the landform-based naming of our neighborhoods, this system ensures that every journey across our campuses begins and ends with confidence. We invite you to utilize this manual as a living guide to stewardship, ensuring that as we grow, we remain a campus that is not only easier to navigate but also more deeply understood and respected.
