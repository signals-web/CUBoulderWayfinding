# How to Use This Manual

To ensure long-term consistency and system integrity, this manual serves as the mandatory framework for all exterior signage within the University of Colorado Boulder's academic and institutional areas. For all new capital projects and major renovations, the designated Project Manager is responsible for the supply and installation of required wayfinding and building identification signage as a primary project scope.
