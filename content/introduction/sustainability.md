## The Living System: How Our Signs Work

The physical standards of our wayfinding system are a testament to the university’s commitment to institutional longevity and sustainability. We view our signs not as temporary fixtures, but as the "foundation and framing of a house." To protect the university’s 100-year investment in its buff sandstone masonry, we have codified a transition away from small, temporary "glued-on" signs that detract from architectural quality. Instead, we prioritize permanent architectural integration through pin letters and carved stone. Our signs are engineered for "Mechanical Permanence," utilizing mechanical fastening over adhesives. This allows individual components, such as a map panel or a nameplate, to be removed, updated, and reattached without replacing the entire sign structure, significantly reducing the system's environmental impact over its lifecycle.

Sustainability is further reinforced through our selection of materials and finishes. We specify high-recycled-content aluminum and the Tiger Drylac powder coat system, which is zero-VOC and offers a minimum lifespan of 10 to 15 years. By utilizing an "8-inch stack logic" for our sandstone bases, we provide the necessary architectural weight to ground the system in the Boulder landscape while protecting the signage from maintenance equipment and environmental wear. Our "layer reduction" strategy brings the colors of the upper information zones closer to the color of the sign body, creating a cleaner profile that complements our architecture rather than competing with it. We avoid high-intensity internal illumination to prevent technical fragility and light pollution, relying instead on existing campus pathway lighting to maintain a "calm" nighttime environment.
