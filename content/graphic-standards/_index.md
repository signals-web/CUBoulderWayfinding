## Messaging Standards

### The Architecture of Attention and the Discipline of Restraint

The primary directive of the University of Colorado Boulder wayfinding system is the preservation of a "calm" navigation experience, a state achieved only through the rigorous management of cognitive load. We recognize that wayfinding is not interpretive signage; it is a specialized form of visual communication design that functions at its most elemental level by helping people "read the world" in order to facilitate arrival. Within the campus landscape, movement and arrival are our primary objectives, while storytelling and institutional history are secondary layers that must never compromise the speed of comprehension or the legibility of the system. By prioritizing the experience of the first-time visitor—our most vulnerable user group—we establish an environment of hospitality where the architecture and the signage work in a state of navigational harmony.

Understanding the psychology of the scanning user is critical to the implementation of these standards, as the human brain possesses a limited capacity for processing new environments. A user in a state of "Movement"—whether walking, cycling, or driving—is scanning the landscape for specific mental anchors and confirmatory cues that support their internal "mental model" of the campus. In this high-stress arrival state, the navigator is forced to filter out ninety percent of available data to find the ten percent required for their immediate task. Conversely, a user in a state of "Dwell" is stationary and engaged, possessing the cognitive bandwidth to read for context and meaning. Our messaging strategy reflects this duality by employing a "graduated approach," ensuring that informational density increases only as the user's velocity decreases.

### The Interpretive Ladder

The implementation of this strategy is governed by the "Interpretive Ladder," a framework that aligns content depth with the duration of the user’s engagement. At the lowest rung of the ladder is the "Glance," a three-second interaction designed for the user in motion who requires immediate confirmation of a destination. As the user reaches a decision point and transitions to a "Pause," they spend ten to thirty seconds orienting themselves through local area maps and subtle micro-interpretation. Finally, at landmarks or plazas where visitors are expected to linger, the "Deep Dive" provides one to three minutes of interpretive narrative. This sequence ensures the right information appears at precisely the right moment, preventing information saturation from diminishing the visitor's confidence.

### The Discipline of Restraint

The "Discipline of Restraint" serves as our operational mantra: just because the university has the space for text does not mean we should use it. The primary purpose of a building sign is identification, and the inclusion of extensive programmatic lists or departmental acronyms is viewed as "information creep" that detracts from a sign’s core functionality. For building identification, messaging is strictly limited to one or two concise, timeless sentences that remain subordinate to the primary building name. We apply this same restraint to the "Thick Edges" of our map signage, which are zones reserved for non-verbal cues such as orientation arrows and accessibility icons. When micro-interpretation is permitted on these edges, it is capped at a strict ceiling of 25–50 words and must never be formatted as a list, chronology, multi-paragraph narrative.
