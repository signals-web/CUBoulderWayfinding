# Building Identification

## Building Identification and Facade Strategy

The university has initiated a comprehensive facade strategy to address the common challenge of "missing facade" identification, where structures appear anonymous from critical approach angles. Our standards require a thorough audit of every building to ensure that identification is visible from multiple directions of travel, particularly elevations facing major pedestrian arteries or transit hubs. This strategy transforms our buildings from silent sandstone masses into legible destinations that confirm the user's arrival at the final nesting step of their journey.

We are definitively moving away from small, temporary "glued-on" signs that detract from the quality of our stone masonry. In their place, we require permanent architectural treatments such as pin letters and carved stone, which are placed strategically to guide users toward primary and accessible entrances. These permanent applications reinforce the university's commitment to quality and longevity, ensuring that the final "breadcrumb" in the wayfinding trail is as substantial as the institution itself.
