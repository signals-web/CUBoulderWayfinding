# Sustainability

## Sustainability as a Lifecycle Commitment

Sustainability at CU Boulder is defined by the entire lifecycle of the wayfinding system, prioritizing durability, engineering for longevity, and ease of maintenance. We specify high-recycled-content aluminum produced in North America and utilize the Tiger Drylac powder coat system, which is zero-VOC and offers a guaranteed lifespan of ten to fifteen years. To ensure our signs remain resistant to wear in our unique climate, we employ "antique vein" and "hammer tone" finishes that provide a subtle, durable texture. This material choice reflects our status as stewards of the campus, protecting the university’s 100-year investment in its physical infrastructure.

The system’s engineering emphasizes "Mechanical Permanence," prioritizing mechanical fastening over adhesives for all primary connections. This allow individual components—such as a specific map panel or a donor nameplate—to be removed, updated, and reattached without requiring the replacement of the entire sign structure. This modularity significantly reduces the system's environmental footprint and allows the university to adapt its navigation systems to changing academic needs with minimal waste. By avoiding the ad hoc, reactionary signage of the past, we create a proactively planned system that remains functional and aesthetically valid for decades.
