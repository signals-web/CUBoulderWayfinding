## Lighting: Subtle and Effective

To maintain a "calm" nighttime campus and adhere to our sustainability goals, we strictly avoid high-intensity internal illumination. Internal lighting frequently causes "lamination" failures where sign faces peel due to heat cycles, and its overly commercial appearance often clashes with the university's academic character. Instead, our strategy relies primarily on existing campus pathway lighting to reveal the sign's presence. This approach reduces light pollution and technical fragility while supporting the environmental aesthetic of our grounds.

Any additional dedicated lighting is restricted to a "top glow" element—a dim, subtle effect that highlights the sign's position without creating glare or excessive light spillage. By leveraging ambient light and specifying non-glare finishes, we ensure that the sign graphic system remains legible after dark without becoming a source of visual noise. This restraint in lighting design supports our broader vision of a campus that remains professional, hospitable, and serene at all hours.
