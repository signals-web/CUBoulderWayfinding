# Master Narrative

## CU Boulder Wayfinding & Interpretive Strategy: A Master Narrative

The Master Narrative represents the philosophical framework guiding all directional and interpretive decisions on campus. It is anchored in the belief that effective wayfinding is an integrated layer of the built environment that reveals the university's logic in sequence.

### Core Principles

- **Philosophy of Scale** — Understanding navigation as spatial psychology and managing cognitive load.
- **Neighborhood Framework** — Organizing the campus into intuitive, landform-based districts.
- **Sustainability** — Engineering for mechanical permanence and institutional longevity.
- **Universal Design** — Committing to equity and accessibility for all users.

### Navigational Layers

Our strategy employs a graduated scale, nesting information across three distinct tiers to ensure clarity and reduce environmental anxiety. By anchoring our nomenclature in the physical reality of the Boulder landscape, we create a system that is both intuitive and enduring.
