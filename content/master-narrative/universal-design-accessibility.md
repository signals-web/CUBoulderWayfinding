# Universal Design & Accessibility

## Universal Design and Accessibility

Wayfinding is fundamentally a tool for equity, and our commitment to universal design ensures that the "mental map" of the campus is available to all users regardless of their mobility or visual status. Accessibility is not a separate layer of our system; it is integrated into the site design of every installation, requiring a level, firm surface and a minimum five-foot turning radius at every marker. To provide a "visual punch" that is immediately recognizable to those with low vision, we utilize a specific, high-contrast ADA blue for all accessible route signs.

Our standards expand upon basic compliance to include services such as testing accommodations and disability offices, ensuring that every user can navigate the university with dignity. By incorporating tactile characters, Grade 2 Braille, and detectable warning strips, we provide the haptic cues necessary for those who read the world by touch rather than sight. This focus on the most vulnerable user group—the first-time visitor facing mobility or sensory challenges—cultivates a sense of security and goodwill that is the hallmark of true campus hospitality.
