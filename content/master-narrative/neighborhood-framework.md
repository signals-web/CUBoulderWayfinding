# Neighborhood Framework

## The Neighborhood Framework: Intuition Over Invention

The sheer magnitude of the CU Boulder landscape can easily overwhelm the senses, making it imperative that we organize the campus into a series of legible "Neighborhoods". However, a naming system only functions if the boundaries and identifiers feel earned and intuitive rather than manufactured by administrative decree. We have shifted our nomenclature away from abstract or invented names like "Horizons" or "Frontier," favoring instead identifiers anchored in the landforms and corridors that users already employ as spatial anchors. Names like The Quad, Creekside, Grandview, and The Grove resonate because they are rooted in the physical reality of the Boulder landscape, making them self-evident to a person standing on the ground.

In areas lacking a dominant historic name, the university employs directional naming conventions—identifying zones as being "North" or "South" of universally recognized landmarks—to establish immediate spatial context. By overlaying walking path data with these neighborhood boundaries, we ensure that the "edges" of our districts align perfectly with primary east-west pedestrian pathways. This alignment allows a first-time visitor to look at a sign and immediately comprehend the character of the area they are entering, reinforcing their mental model through real-time physical confirmation. The goal is a landscape where the transition between districts is felt and understood, transforming the campus from a fragmented collection of buildings into a singular, connected image.
