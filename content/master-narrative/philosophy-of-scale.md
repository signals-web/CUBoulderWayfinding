## Philosophy of Scale: Navigation as Spatial Psychology

Effective campus wayfinding is far more than a collection of individual signs; it is a coordinated system of scales designed to mirror the complex way the human brain processes and interprets new environments. At CU Boulder, our standards represent a definitive move away from the "all-inclusive" map—a singular artifact that fails the user by attempting to answer every potential question simultaneously. Such artifacts inevitably increase "cognitive load," a psychological state where the navigator is forced to filter out ninety percent of available information to locate the critical ten percent required for their immediate task. By utilizing a graduated approach, we align our physical infrastructure with the principles of spatial psychology, ensuring the campus remains legible even to those in high-stress arrival states.

Navigation is an active, ongoing process requiring constant mental engagement, yet it is most successful when it enables the user to form a reliable "mental model" of the site. This internal map provides the baseline confidence necessary for exploration, allowing visitors to predict the landscape before they take their first physical step. Our strategy utilizes "Progressive Disclosure" to support this model, nesting information in three distinct steps: the Campus-Wide scale for broad orientation, the Local Area scale for immediate decision-making, and the Building and Adjacency level for task-specific arrival. This sequence creates a "calm" environment where context is stripped away as the user nears their goal, focusing their attention entirely on identifying the final portal or accessible route.
